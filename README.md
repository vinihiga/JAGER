# JAGER
## Just A Game Engine, Right?!

<p align="center"><b>Current Version: Alpha 0.1</b></p>

JAGER is a FREE Open Source Game Engine for iOS platforms started by @vinnyhiga137 on January 10th - 2020, because he wanted to study how a Game Engine works by architecting it, but he also wanted to share his work with everyone for free.

The main idea is to build a Game Engine that focus on 2D Games with Tilemap System and Realtime Shadow system by only using Swift and Objective-C.

### Why not other default / popular engines instead this one?

**Actually this engine only (and for now) uses Metal as standard API for rendering data and Swift as main language, but the idea is to try to develop a Game Engine with a higher performance instead the ones that uses OpenGL.**

# Milestones

This project is in early version (ALPHA) and has the idea to try to build a simple 2D Game Engine for iOS devices with following features:

* Support common images formats (like JPEG and PNG with Alpha).
* Render 2D Graphics with Metal Shaders.
* Support to realtime shadows.
* Support to tilemap system.
* Support to basic physics (collision detection for a variety of geometric objects).
* Support to pathfinding (A.I.)
* Support to basic audio system.
* Support to custom gestures.

# How to build

On Mac OS Catalina (x64):

* You must have the lastest XCode installed for Mac OS.

* If you want to change the Engine Code, you must open the JAGER project.

* If you want to change the Game (itself) Code, you must open the Game project.


# How to contribute

You can contribute by helping with the current "to do tasks" on the Kanban that are being worked on "Projects" tab above.  Afther that, you can make a Pull Request and your code will be analyzed if it's possible to be added into a future version.
