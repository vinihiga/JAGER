* Support common images formats (like JPEG and PNG with Alpha).
* Render 2D Graphics with Metal Shaders.
* Support to realtime shadows.
* Support to tilemap system.
* Support to basic physics (collision detection for a variety of geometric objects).
* Support to basic audio system.
* Support to custom gestures.
