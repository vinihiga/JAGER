# About the Project

This project has the idea to try to build a simple 2D Game Engine with following features:

* Support common images formats (like JPEG and PNG with Alpha).
* Render 2D Graphics with Metal Shaders.
* Support to realtime shadows.
* Support to tilemap system.
* Support to basic physics (collision detection for a variety of geometric objects).

# How to build

On Mac OS Catalina (x64):

* You must have the lastest XCode installed for Mac OS.

* If you want to change the Engine Code, you must open the JAGER project.

* If you want to change the Game (itself) Code, you must open the Game project.
